# QuakeFlow: A Scalable Deep-learning-based Earthquake Monitoring Workflow with Cloud Computing
[![documentation](https://github.com/wayneweiqiang/QuakeFlow/actions/workflows/docs.yml/badge.svg)](https://wayneweiqiang.github.io/QuakeFlow/)

## Overview

QuakeFlow is a scalable deep-learning-based earthquake monitoring system with cloud computing. It applies the state-of-art deep learning/machine learning models for earthquake detection. With auto-scaling enabled on Kubernetes, our system can balance computational loads with computational resources.

## Deployment

We designed our system in a way that it's easy to deploy, reproducible and flexible where users can deploy it on any platform of their choice.


To deploy the system on google cloud platform (GCP), check out the [GCP README](gcp_readme.md).

To deploy the system on Kubernetes on-premise, check out the [Kubernetes README](k8s_readme.md).

To test the code locally, check out the guide [here](kafka-spark).
